# Project

Ball Model Project for CHBE done by BIoT. Deployment will occur on a Raspberry Pi.

# Installation

Installation really depends on your OS. It can be a pain. If you are running WSL I would recommend building it in Windows. 

## Windows

[Windows Installation](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/installation/installation-windows.html)

I have also provided a `setup.py` file. Once you have your VirtualEnv run:

```
$ python setup.py develop
```

This didn't appear to work for installation on the Raspberry Pi.

## OS X

# Deployment

I think [this](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/guide/packaging-osx.html) is the documentation needed for packaging deployment.
